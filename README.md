# freebies-hunt-api
API for the digital freebies from Freebies Hunt as an npm package. It's my personal list of digital freebies that I found quite useful. Of course, why not share it.

This also serves as a production use case for my JSON database system, [`jayson-db`](https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/jayson-db) (and also save some money by creating my own little database management system thingamajig ~~It's expensive relative to my budget, OK?~~). Also, it's actually fun.

## Contributing
You can contribute mainly either by code, feedback, criticisms, or link suggestions. 

If you want to contribute through code, do the following for the development build:

- fork the repo (click the 'Fork' button)
- clone the repo into your machine (`git clone <GIT_FORKED_REPO_URL>`)
- go to the project directory (`cd freebies-hunt-api` or something similar)
- install the dependencies (`npm install`)
- start the `jayson-db` program (`npx jayson-db get freebies.json`)

Also, read the [code documentation I've written at the `docs/` folder](./docs/getting-started.md). It'll get you a general idea of what the code does and where to start.

If you want to contribute through feedback either by constructive criticisms or suggestions, freely file an issue and spark a discussion about it.

If you want to add a resource to be included in the API, **don't edit the JSON**. Instead, file an issue and I'll consider it. This may be a personal list but I'm open for suggestions. This also means that I'm quite strict when considering a resource. One more thing, make sure the suggested resource is free (or has generous free-tier services). There's one rule to this which is make sure that it is related to programming- and computer-related stuff (most of the time). But even with that rule, I can't really say a hard rule on this. It'll most likely be a case-by-case basis so really, feel free to suggest something.

Anyways, I'm looking forward for your contributions. ðŸ™‚

P.S. If you want to, you can use [`jayson-db`](https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/jayson-db) for a personal project or something. Like any of my publicly released projects, I'm open for suggestions, feedbacks, and contributions to make the better outcome of the project.
